# Packer
Learning HashiCorp Packer 
Learn how to use Packer, a popular DevOps tool for simplifying the creation of machine images, and implement a continuous development approach to changes in your software. Packet standardizes the creation of machine images for cloud and on-premises environments, making the process less time-consuming and error-prone. In this course, instructor Chris O'Dell shows how to build Ubuntu images for environments like Amazon EC2, provision and debug the images with a configuration management tool like Ansible, and build hardened images that can withstand the latest attack vectors. Plus, learn how to build a Jenkins pipeline for Packer images to run automated builds from source control.
